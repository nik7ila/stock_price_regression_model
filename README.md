# Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This beginner project builds a Linear Regression model to predict next-day stock prices using historical data.

## 🔧 Key Highlights
- Uses `yfinance` to collect data for AAPL
- Creates lag features to simulate daily forecasting
- Trains a linear model and evaluates with MSE
- Visualizes actual vs predicted prices

## 📊 Output
Model shows reasonable prediction trends but is limited by the simplicity of linear regression for noisy time series data.
